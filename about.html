<h1>About</h1><p>What is FlandersCraft all about.</p><p>FlandersCraft is a Minecraft Network which started in 2013 and to this day is known as the CastleCrafters Servers.</p><p>CastleCrafters merged with FlandersCraft due to the fact that the previous owners had no intentions on keeping the network online and therefor gave it away to a former administrator from the<br>CastleCrafters Servers. That same administrator from the CastleCrafters Servers was at that time the Owner of the FlandersCraft Network.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
